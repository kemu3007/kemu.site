Since the number of accesses is not so much, we do not put Postgres and support it with SQLite.\r\n\r\nThe load balancer uses ALB to provide redirection processing of http-> https. If you use CLB, you will not be able to do this process, so you need to refer to the following pages.\r\n\r\n[How can I redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS with Classic Load Balancer? ] (https://aws.amazon.com/jp/premiumSupport/knowledge-center/redirect-http-https-elb/)\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of the above processing is that the branch processing of IF is performed to all requests, so that the load on the Web server is likely to increase. Also, considering using AWS WAF etc., it is better to move to ALB.\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Current site [portal.kemu.site] (https://portal.kemu.site)\r\n<Img Width = \"540\" Alt = \"Screenshot 2022-03-20 13 19 50\" SRC = \"https://user- Images.githubuserContent.com png \">\r\n\r\nThe Django server was abolished by collecting GitHub's iSSUE on GitHub Actions, outputting it in JSON format, and handling it as a pseudo -back end. This simplifies the SSH security and management procedure for the web server.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is no need to think about the price of EC2, etc., so it is also optimized in terms of cost.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe configuration diagram is described in [Tracery] (https://tracery.jp/).
