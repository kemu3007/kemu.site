Because the number of accesses is not expected to be that large, postgres is not set up, and sqlite is used.\n\nThe load balancer uses ALB to perform the http - > https redirection process, but this process is not possible when using CLB, so it is necessary to refer to the following page.\n\n[How do I redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS with Classic Load Balancer?] (https://aws.amazon.com/jp/premiumsupport/knowledge- center/redirect- http- https- elb/)\n\nThe disadvantage of the above process is that the load on the web server tends to increase as if branching is performed for all requests. Also, considering the use of AWS WAF, it is better to migrate to ALB.\n\n\n#### Current site [portal.kemu.site](https://portal.kemu.site)\n<img width=\"540\" alt=\"screenshot 2022- 03- 20 13 19 50\" src=\"https://user- images.githubusercontent.com/29157528/159147978- 0b0dcba4- c70c- 4de9- adc9- 8afae77027a0.png\">\n\nThe django server was eliminated by collecting Github issues on Github Actions and outputting them in json format and treating them as a pseudo backend. This simplifies ssh security and administrative procedures to the web server.\n\nIt is also cost- optimized because there is no need to think about EC2 fees, etc.\n\n- - - \n\nThe diagram is available at [tracery](https://tracery.jp/). This tool is very useful to create a diagram tied to a project, because if you use draw.io at random, the root area of google drive will get dirty.",
