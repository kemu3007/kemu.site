    "body": "OGP is not displayed on twitter.\n\nThis is because the bot to get OGP does not execute js, and there is no HTML file existed in the corresponding link for SPA.\n\nTherefore, usually using lambda, etc., to display pages for bots, and other accesses are used to fly to S3.\n\nHowever, this time, I searched for solutions because I wanted to complete GitHub Pages only.\n\n\n### Solution\n\n_If you don't have a page, add a page.\n\nThis time, we added the link directory (if this time, \"src/blog\").\n\nTo create a page, execute Python script in Action when deploying and generate the file as follows:\n\n```\nsrc/blog/index.html\nsrc/blog/<:id>/index.html\n```\n\nSee also: https://github.com/kemu3007/portal/blob/master/create_pages.py\n\nWe prepare the base HTML as the contents, and modify the contents of the title, image, and description that we want to display on the page, and save the HTML file in the directory matching the link of the page. It is a form.\n\nIn this case, only 踏OGP is transferred to HTML without using SPA when linking directly, so we will transition to the route link wherengular application exists in this page, passing the current path with the query parameter, and transition with internal link.\n\n* Note that `route.snapshot.queryParams` is empty because this process is not inside the router- outlet.\n\nbot: Link - > HTML for `OGP only`\nViewer: Link - > `OGP only HTML` - > `Angular Application`\n\nIf you transition to an application once, all of the internal links will be processed.\n\n\n### Comments\n\nIt is a simple and simple way, but it took a little time.\n\nIt is a spirit that it can be a personal blog.\n\nIt seems that SEO measures are also a little bit gone, so if you have a better way, please tell me in a comment.",
