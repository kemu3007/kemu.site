Note that if you do not set the environment variable, you need to specify `NODE_VERSION` in the environment variable because the version of Node is automatically 12.\n\nAlthough Python scripts can be rotated with preイメージment, 3.8 or more interpreters are not present in the image, so they cannot be used. This must also be specified with `PYTHON_VERSION`.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29157528/167157817-3dd93ca1-fd8b-44d7-8bfc-06d703357f96.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29157528/167162708-2a5a77fd-7eec-4edd-9e18-55cce7702887.png)\n\nYou can see that the process is running automatically when you push it from GitHub.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29157528/167157214-336b032d-708e-4510-8592-473da8a4d5f0.png)\n\n## User \n\nConfigure from Settings - > General - > Access Policy.\n\nIf you want to set a policy for the domain of the preview environment, you can create a policy for `*.project.pages.dev` and `project.pages.dev`.\n\nThe following login screen will be displayed.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29157528/167158540-73cb3628-23b6-4f73-ba63-0abaaa405453.png)\n\n#\n\nIt takes more than GitHub Pages, but it is easy to implement user authentication, and it seems to be bad for cooperation with repository. (It is a little difficult to use the management screen)\n\n[Cloud。re Zero Trust] (https://www.cloud。re.com/en- jp/products/zero- trust/) The application policy of Cloud。re Pages was not created from the screen, and I felt that it was a little difficult to understand when I need to create a policy from Pages.\n\n\n",
