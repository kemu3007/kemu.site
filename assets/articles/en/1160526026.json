If you try to register withサイトが, you can not reach the site.\n\nIn conclusion, [Http Error 464] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_jp/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load- balancer- trouble ing.html#http- 464- issues) was included.\n\nIt seems that the protocol inside the load balancer did not match the request.\n\nThe communication to the target group of ALB was set to http1.1 and nginx on EC2 had to be modified to http1.1.\n\n464 errors were displayed on the screen when google search console was put on the site map.\n\n\n### Counter s\n```bash\ncurl http://example.com/ --http1.1\ncurl http://example.com/ --http2\n```\n\nYou need to check with curl command.\n\n\n - - - \n\n## 2. Name.com can only register CNAME records in sub \n\nAlthough the IP address is assigned to the ALB, the IP address is changed at the time of scaleout rather than fixed.\n\nThat’s why you need to create CNAME records in DNS settings for your domain.\n\nHowever, name.com does not allow the creation of CNAME records other than sub、s. Therefore, I thought that the name dot com was difficult to use overall, so I decided to transfer the domain to Route 53.\n\nThere is a limit to the top domain that can be managed by Route53, and `site` is not applicable.\n\nAmazon Route 53\n\nThen, we created a zone in Route 53, set the NS in the created zone to NS on the name dot com side, and changed it from Route 53 to ALB.\n\n* There is also a way to assign and use IP address using アドレス Global Accelerator, but this time I saw that I don’t want to spend money & it seems to be quite priced.\nI think that it is important to put it in aビアbia project because it seems to improve performance.\n\n[global Global Accelerator] blogs- global- ac)rator.s blog- by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blogs- global- ac)rator.s)- order=desc&aws- global- ac)rator- wn.s)- by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&aws- global- ac)rator- wn.s)- order=desc)\n\n\n - - - \n\nI had a lot of information about a blog paid version (which makes a redirection setting to www.) that I can not reach the site, and it took time to solve the cause.",
